    <H1><center>What is Anime?</h2>
  <body text = black><P>  Anime has gained popularity in the United States in the past decade. However, some people are confused about anime and the culture surrounding the genre of entermtainment. Simply put, anime is a specific type of animation style produced in Japan. Anime has been around for about a century. It did not become known in the states until the 90s. Anime has a plethora of different art styles, genres, and music. There is a myth that anime is only for children. Anime is for all age groups and genders. There is anime that is catered to younger kids, teenagers, and adults.</p>

  <h1><center> Introduction to Anime Genres</h1></center>
   
<p><h3><em> Shounen</em> </h3>
Shonen anime is a category of anime made specifically for younger boys. Usually there is some type of main character, normally male, who has muscles, good martial arts abilities, and some type of ability to enhance their strength.</P> 

<p><h3><em> Shoujo </em></h3>
Shoujo is the opposite of shonen, translated in English as young girl. Shoujo focuses more on the interpersonal relationship and romance in the story rather than the fighting and action. The series tend to be more dramatic, but also still include the adventure, comedy and action that are prevalent in shonen.</p>

<p><h3><em> Mystery</em> </h3>
Whether it's supernatural forces or gruesome murders, mystery anime focuses on the unresolved questions surrounding characters and their efforts to find answers. From deadly diseases and events to someone's sinister past, these anime characters are on the path to learn the truth and nothing will get in their way.
</p>

<p><h3><em> Seinen </em></h3>
The word "seinen" means "youth" in Japanese, but Seinen anime and manga are those targeting young adult male audiences, with the female-targeted equivalent being "Josei." Once again, "Seinen" manga can be works of fantasy, horror, science fiction, Isekai, or any other subgenre you can think of. 

</p>

<p><h3><em>Sports </em></h3>
 sports anime are shows that cover characters engaging in athletic competition. Popular choices in this category includes basketball, tennis, baseball, and soccer. Other sports exists as well. As time goes on, more and more of these series are produced. Just like real sports, shows in this subgenre are action-packed!
